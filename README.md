# restaurant-recommender

This project is part of my CodeAcademy curriculum. It recommends a restaurant from a list of options. The program should use a few variables, like price range, delivery time, distance, and whether the restaurant is open in order to recommend customers the perfect spot.

I'm using Vite(https://www.franksierra.net) to compile TypeScript.
